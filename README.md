# ASNA AVR 2023 Web class -- student/teacher project

This is the project that we created together in the June 2023 ASNA Web class. It is based on the [avr-asp-net-05-gridview](https://github.com/ASNA/avr-asp-net-05-gridview) project with one major exception: The *avr-asp-net-05-gridview gridview* project uses the *app_code/CustomerByNameList* class to partition away the file IO logic from the ASPX page's code behind. 

Most of the customer's existing in-house projects have the file IO inline in the ASPX page code behind.  *avr-asp-net-05-gridview* that we did together more represents the customer's existing code.
